<h2>Theatre and Folk Masks<wbr> from the New Forest</h2>
<p>False Faces is an artisanal mask studio, creating sculptural masks for theatre. Each mask is hand-crafted in leather or via hybrid craft-and-digital processes, designed first and foremost as a functional object for the stage.</p>

<p>My practice is rooted equally in craft and play. I trained in physical theatre and mask-making in the Commedia dell’Arte tradition with leading authorities including École Jacques Lecoq, Carlo Boso, Antonio Fava, Sarah Sartori and Paola Piizi at the Sartori Museum, and Stefano Perocco di Meduna at A.I.D.A.S. de Versailles.</p>

<p>As a proud member of the New Forest Marque, I draw on the folklore, history, landscapes and wildlife of the New Forest, and use local materials wherever possible.</p>
