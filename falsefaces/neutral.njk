<h1>Neutral Masks</h1>

<h2>The Theory</h2>
<p>The Neutral Mask was designed in collaboration between sculptor Amleto Sartori and actor and teacher, Jacques Lecoq. The mask is a versatile tool in actor training, to try to pin down concisely what it is for and how it works, in my experience leads to endlessly being corrected by people who know better.</p>
<p>My understanding is this: the mask has an open and engaged expression, something close to wonder, but remaining ambiguous. It is the face of someone who is about to do something. It's an expression that doens't impose emotion or intention on the actor. By rendering the actor's face "neutral" in this sense, the actor is required to communicate using the full body.</p>
<p>It has the effect of "enlarging" the body, making it seem as if the actor is taking up more space. It amplifies the idiosyncracies in the actor's body - watching an actor in the Neutral mask you notice every tick or unconscious gesture or peculiarity of posture. After some time using these masks, actors learn to simplify their actions, dropping anything non-essential, and finding a timing that seems clear and uninflected.</p>
<p>In practical terms, you might see actors standing straight up, with both feet firmly planted, the chest open and arms held slightly away from the sides. The body will rarely if ever be in contratortion. A great deal of the expression is found in "attitudes" - the tilt forwards or backwards of the torso, and continuity of lines through the body.</p>

<h2>My version</h2>
<p>With my versions of the Neutral, I have followed the basic sculptural design in the Sartori masks, and simplified in a similar way. A common criticism of a lot of versions of these masks is that they seem explicitly Caucasian. I have attempted to make my masks more ambiguous, and I'm offering a range of designs which I hope will give options to suit most users. The colours of the masks, in my view, are not meant to mimic skin tones but to use the raw tones of natural materials like wood and leather.</p>
