<h1>Pedagogical Masks</h1>

<p>Masks for teaching and theatre exploration. For a really genuine Neutral Mask, the only place you can get it is from Sarah Sartori - visit sartorimaskmuseum.it and find their contact details - but to meet demand I have designed my own versions, which are mainly what you will see below. For those, contact me.
