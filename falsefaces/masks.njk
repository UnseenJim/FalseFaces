<h1>Masks</h1>
<p>I make masks in a range of materials, suited to design and purpose. Leather masks are the highest quality option for performance work. They are light, durable and beautifully responsive under stage or natural lighting.</p>
<p>My 3D printed masks are made with a wood-based bioplastic that offers a really competative vegan option at a slightly more affordable price point.</p>
