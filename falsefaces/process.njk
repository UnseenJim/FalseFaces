<h1>Techniques &amp; Materials</h1>
<p>My work combines traditional craftsmanship with contemporary processes. Each material demands a different approach â€” from sculpting and forming leather by hand, to designing and printing in wood-based PLA before applying wax finishes derived from linseed oil, beeswax, and carnauba.</p>

<p>Every stage, from digital design to surface treatment, is guided by the same principles of durability, responsiveness, and character. The goal is always the same: a mask that feels alive in the hands of a performer.</p>
