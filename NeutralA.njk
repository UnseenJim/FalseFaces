<h1>Neutral Mask A Design</h1>
<p>Neutral A is slightly smaller and more delicate than the others. There is a slight upturn to the nose, and the standard size is small (13.5cm across the cheekbones, 18cm brow to chin). As with all the masks, resizing and some alterations can be done on request - just let me know what you're looking for. This mask is priced at £150 for 3D printed and £350 for leather. </p>
